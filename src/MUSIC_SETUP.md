# Background Music Setup Instructions

## Adding "Aavan Jaavan" from WAR2

To add the actual song to your birthday website, follow these steps:

### Option 1: Local File (Recommended)
1. **Get the song file**: Download "Aavan Jaavan" from WAR2 in MP3 format
2. **Create a public folder**: Create a `public` folder in your project root if it doesn't exist
3. **Add the music**: Place the song file as `public/aavan-jaavan-war2.mp3`
4. **Update the path**: In `/components/BackgroundMusic.tsx`, change line 18 to:
   ```typescript
   const songUrl = "/aavan-jaavan-war2.mp3";
   ```

### Option 2: Streaming URL
If you have a streaming URL for the song:
1. Replace the `songUrl` in `/components/BackgroundMusic.tsx` with your streaming URL
2. Make sure the URL allows cross-origin requests

### Option 3: Alternative Songs
You can also use any other romantic Hindi song by:
1. Updating the song file path
2. Changing the display name in the component (line 87)

### Project Structure After Adding Music:
```

â”œâ”€â”€ components/

### Browser Note:
Modern browsers require user interaction before playing audio, so the music won't auto-play until Hamsa clicks the play button. This is perfect for user experience!

### Testing:
1. Add the music file
2. Open the website
3. Navigate to the Home section
4. Look for the pink floating music button in the bottom-right corner
5. Click to play the romantic background music!
